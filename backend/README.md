# Welcome to the Media Manager (Back-end)
## Created by Duke Norsworthy

The purpose of this project is to maintain media across our home, including books, CD's, Vinyl, DVD and Blu-Ray, and games.
Over the years, we've been given so much media, passed down from family or gifted by friends.
To track them in our home - or when others borrow our media - we want a system that is easy to add to, update when conditions of the media change, and remove when we give away, sell, or trash something. 

Stretch goals include:
- AI-powered photo recognition: Take a photo of the media and auto-fill the name/category/condition/etc. of the media in question.
- Estimated value of the media, based on year, condition, and any other factors necessary
